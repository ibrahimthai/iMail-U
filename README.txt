Email Client GUI (iMail U)

Program Description
*********************
This program is a special Graphical User Interface that allows you to send emails to other people. This program is implemented using NetBeans IDE, but I built it WITHOUT the NetBeans GUI Builder because I wanted to take control of the process and understand the concepts behind creating a GUI. 

I also did not use the Java GUI Frames, and decided to make the frames myself using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (screenshots are available).


*************************
Compilation Instruction
*************************
NOTE: Before you compile, you must install the Javax Mail Package if it's not found nor exist in your NetBeans IDE.

1. Download this project

2. Open NetBeans and open this project

3. Click on "Run"

4. As you run the program, you need to input the correct SMTP Server. The Port Number is already given (587). To write the correct SMTP Server, you can input:

Host: smtp.gmail.com

You also need to login to your email, in order to send your emails to someone else.

Once all the Setup requirements are complete, you're ready to compose a new email to someone.
